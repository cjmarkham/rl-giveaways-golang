The following is a test of GoLang.

It pulls data from a seeded database and displays said data in HTML

## Installation and Running
* `dep install`
* `go run main.go`

## Seeding the database
The seeding script makes assumptions in the URL for the database so
those will need to be changed should you wish to run this script.
* `go run seed.go`
